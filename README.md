# Netflix-Data-Analysis
This case study is an apt one for aspiring Data Analysts to start with. It helps understand how to approach a case study, how the data needs to be preprocessed, what metrics are important for an industry and what are the challenges a dataset can pose in the industry

The dataset lists the TV shows and movies released on Netflix, an American subscription
streaming service.
The data gives details of cast, director, duration etc. and spans across different countries
and years. The dataset can be found at the following link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows

The goal of this Exploratory Data Analysis is to identify patterns and generate insights
that can help Netflix understand which type of shows/movies to produce and how to
increase footprint globally

1.The analysis begins with basic observations on the dataset including statistical analysis, identifying missing values and columns with nested values and also time period covered in the data

2.Data Cleaning is the next step in order to make efficient analysis. The nested values are split into separate rows and missing value imputation is done based on dependent columns

3.Univariate and Bivariate analysis helps in uncovering insights and trends. 

4.Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn packages help in better understanding of what the data shows. Barplots, Histogram, Box plots etc. make the analysis more rigorous
